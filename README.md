# DPS Challenge Mission 1
## ***Build and deploy a model with Vertex AI***


Description
In this challenge, used Googleâ€™s managed ML platform Vertex AI to build an end-to-end machine learning workflow.

 You use the Auto MPG dataset from Kaggle to predict the fuel efficiency of a vehicle using a basic regression with TensorFlow. 
 Generate the model prediction results for the following input array: test_mpg = [1, 2, 3, 2, -2, -1, -2, -1, 0].
